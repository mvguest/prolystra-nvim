# Prolystra NVIM

Prolystra is a custom flavor of LazyVim
The name comes from Prolystra lithographica, one of the earliest fossilized Jurassic feathers ever discovered, belonging to a cicada of the genus Prolystra — a reference that also inspires its cicada logo.

Beyond the etymology, the name reflects the project’s core idea: just as cicadas undergo metamorphosis, Prolystra is designed to be **highly adaptable** and **easily customizable**, allowing each user to shape the configuration around their own workflow.
